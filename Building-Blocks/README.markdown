# Building-Blocks

Here we build the 'real thing'!

All parts and program blocks here are designed to minimize footprints of any
kind (registers, processing cycles, storage space, ...) and maximize
performance.

MObject is expected to do multiple things at the same time. The file
MObject.asm contains the complete code for MObject. All other files contain
contain specialised parts of MObject code.

These parts are for demonstration and research.

Goal of this place is to optimize the code far behind any imagination ;-)
