MObject

is an physical, 'intelligent' object to be used in music and art.

It responds to handling and action, both are yet to be defined.

There are different sensors - currently a 3 axes accelerometer - and different
output devices - currently 5 LEDs and one digital-to-analog converter - to do
the experiments and feasibility studies.

Currently the LEDs are used as 'debugging display'
