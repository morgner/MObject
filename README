===MObject===

is a physical, 'intelligent' object to be used in music and art.

It responds to handling and action, both are yet to be defined.

There are different sensors - currently a 3 axes accelerometer - and different
output devices - currently 5 LEDs and one digital-to-analog converter - to do
the experiments and feasibility studies.

Currently the LEDs are used as 'debugging display' and the DAC is used to
output sounds depending on the position of the object in space.

 * If you whish to see some C/C++ code for your research, goto 'Analysis'.
