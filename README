===MObject===

is a physical, 'intelligent' object to be used in music and art.

It responds to handling and action, both are yet to be defined.

There are different sensors - currently a 3 axes accelerometer - and different
output devices - currently 5 LEDs and one digital-to-analog converter - to do
the experiments and feasibility studies.

Currently the LEDs are used as 'debugging display' and the DAC is used to
output sounds depending on the position of the object in space.

 * If you're in a hurry and in search of the 'real code' goto 'Building-Blocks'.
 * If you whish to see some C/C++ code for your research, goto 'Analysis'.

===STATE OF THE ART===

Currently the state of the art of MObject is to change the sound produced to
one out of six depending on it's orientation in the world. Next are two steps

 (1) Change the hardware to ATmega 8 (to speed it up)
 (2) Sound fading to make a more natural sounding musical object
 (3) Percussion detection to finaly make the object usable
 (4) Design a usefull PCB to integrate MObject into objects
 (5) Develop interobject communicaiton maechanics to provide swarm 'intelligence'
