# Analysis

Here we show code fro two sorts of analyses:

1) Test of Sensors and Actors
2) Research on how to use them

So you will find basic code to use devices or recognize sensor
input, mainly in C++.

The real code will be in Assembler for ever. This project is all
for assembler code. Only experimental or analysis code will be
in C++ or other languages for coding efficience.

Our asm code is to be optimized far above normal expectation.
