==Sensore Resonses==

Some sensores are no simple swtiches. If so, here is the folder to describe the
relevant behavior.

This is not a theoretical research study. We only analyse the sensor responses
as far as we need it to fulfill out immediate requirements. For example:

  We need to recognize a position of 23 degree leftside:

  Then we turn the sensor 23Â° to the left side and measure the unfiltered
  sensore response in unnamed units for further reference.

  Pragmatically, not scientific!
