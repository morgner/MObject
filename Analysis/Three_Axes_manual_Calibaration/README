==Three_Axes_manual_Calibaration==

Used to find out the numerical limits given back from our 3 axis acceleromenter

The code is in 'Arduino' or C/C++ so so easy to understand and in no way any
ressource protective.

This C/C++ source is for calibration only! We calibrate the pplication, not
the senosre ;-)
