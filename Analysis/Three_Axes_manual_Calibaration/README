==Three_Axes_manual_Calibaration==

Used to find out the numerical limits given back from our 3 axis acceleromenter

The code is written in 'Arduino' (as git it names) or C/C++. So it should be
easy to understand but in no way any ressource protective or protectiv in
anything.

This C/C++ source is for calibration only!. We calibrate the application, not
the sensore ;-)
