==Three_Axes_discrete_Orientation_Recognition==

Demonstrates how to recognize discrete positions using a 3 axis acceleromenter

The code is written in 'Arduino' or C/C++ so easy to understand and in no way
any ressource protective or timing respecting.

This C/C++ source is for analysis only. It will help thinking on how to do it
the right way. In a way.
